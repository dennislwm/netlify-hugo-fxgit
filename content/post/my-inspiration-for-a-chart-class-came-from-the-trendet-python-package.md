My inspiration from the [trendet](https://github.com/alvarobartt/trendet) Python package is to create a general method for a ChartCls class, that conveniently draws a span of vertical lines to highlight up and down trends on a given chart. 

Read to the end of article for the ****SPOILER****.

## What is trendet?

The [**trendet**](https://github.com/alvarobartt/trendet) Python package comes with an easy trend detection tool. It conveniently plots a chart that highlights both the uptrend regions and downtrend regions, in green color and red color, respectively.

## Prerequisites

* [**trendet**](https://github.com/alvarobartt/trendet) - Python package to detect trends
* [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) - Python package to plot charts
* [**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Python package to plot lines

## Step 1 - Understand the trendet code sample

[**trendet**](https://github.com/alvarobartt/trendet) is a Python package to automatically detect trends for any given time series data, e.g. S&P 500. This package has been created to support [investpy](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy) features when it comes to data retrieval.

The full sample code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alvarobartt/98f94dcfec59f78a16ad2edbf464ce75#file-identify_all_trends-py).

The **identify_all_trends**() function returns a DataFrame consisting of a time series data for a given symbol.

     df = trendet.identify_all_trends(stock='baba',
                                      country='united states',
                                      from_date='01/01/2020',
                                      to_date='09/07/2020',
                                      window_size=5,
                                      identify='both')

In addition to the OHLC columns, the function returns two columns, i.e. "**Up Trend**" and "**Down Trend**", both of type string.

For example, the "**Up Trend**" column consists of either NaN or string values, such as "A", "B", "C", etc. Rows that have the same values, e.g. "A", belong to the same group. 

Both the "**Up Trend**" and "**Down Trend**" columns can consists of multiple groups, where each group consists of the same consecutive value, e.g. "AAAA".

## Step 2 - Preparing the data for a chart

The **matplotlib** Python package contains a function **axvspan**() that draws a span of vertical lines for a range of index, which is typically Date, on the x-axis.

The object **ax** is of type axes, which is a return object from **matplotlib**, when you create a figure.

The for loop gets each unique **label** from **labels**, and passes the first argument to **axvspan**().

     df[df['Up Trend'] == label].index[0]

The first part before the dot (.) is a subset of the DataFrame, where "**Up Trend**" equals **label**, while the second part after the dot, index[0], returns the Date of the first row of the subset.

The second argument to axvspan() is similar to the first argument.

     df[df['Up Trend'] == label].index[-1]

The second part after the dot, index[-1], returns the Date of the last row of the subset.

The third and fourth parameters of the function **axvspan**() are straightforward, **alpha** of type float is the opacity (0-1), while **color** of type string is self-explanatory.

The variable **labels** is assigned to a list of unique objects in column "**Up Trend**", e.g. ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

     labels = df['Up Trend'].dropna().unique().tolist()
     for label in labels:
         sns.lineplot(...)
         ax.axvspan(df[df['Up Trend'] == label].index[0],
                    df[df['Up Trend'] == label].index[-1],
                    alpha=0.2,
                    color='green')

After loop completes for "Up Trend" column, we perform the same function for "Down Trend column.

     labels = df['Down Trend'].dropna().unique().tolist()
     for label in labels:
         sns.lineplot(...)
         ax.axvspan(df[df['Down Trend'] == label].index[0],
                    df[df['Down Trend'] == label].index[-1],
                    alpha=0.2,
                    color='red')

## Step 3 - Create method for a ChartCls

We want to create a general method **MainAddSpan**(), for a ChartCls class, as part of a larger collection of methods for plotting time series data on a chart.

You can read the article [Object-oriented programming for data scientists](https://towardsdatascience.com/object-oriented-programming-for-data-scientists-build-your-ml-estimator-7da416751f64) to learn more about Python classes.

We can then conveniently draw a span of vertical lines to highlight up and down trends on a given chart.

This method **MainAddSpan**() takes four arguments, **dfTag**, **lstTag**, **dblOpacity**, **strColor**.

* dfTag is a DataFrame that consists of tags in a time series format, i.e. index is of type Date
* lstTag is a list of unique tags
* dblOpacity is a double for alpha between 0.0 and 1.0 (Default='0.2')
* strColor is a string for color (Default='green')

This method does not have a return value, however it draws a span of vertical lines to the chart object of the **ChartCls** class.

         def MainAddSpan(self, dfTag, lstTag, dblOpacity=0.2, strColor='green'):
             df = dfTag
             axs = self._axsMAIN
             for s in (lstTag):
                 axs.axvspan(dates.date2num(dfTag[dfTag==s].index[0]), dates.date2num(dfTag[dfTag==s].index[-1]), alpha=dblOpacity, color=strColor)

In this example, I create an object ChartCls, and call the method MainAddSpan().

     #
     # create ChartCls instance
     chart = ChartCls(test._dfDbs, intSub=2)
     #
     # build indicator
     chart.BuildOscillator(1, test._dfDbs['Dbs'], intUpper=3, intLower=-3, strTitle="Dbs")
     chart.BuildOscillator(0, test._dfDbs['DbsMa'], intUpper=3.75, intLower=-3.75, strTitle="DbsMa")
     #
     # get the chart axes 
     ax = chart._axsMAIN
     #
     # build tag column based on the indicator DbsMa
     lstTag = test.BuildTag('DbsMa', 3.75)
     #
     # call the method MainAddSpan()
     chart.MainAddSpan(df['Tag'], lstTag[lstTag>0], 0.2, 'green')
     chart.MainAddSpan(df['Tag'], lstTag[lstTag<0], 0.2, 'red')
     #
     # plot the chart
     chart.BuildMain(strTitle="SPY")

## Conclusion

In this article, you have explored the trendet Python package. You have understood how draw a span of vertical lines for a range of index, which is typically Date, on the x-axis. This is typically performed to highlight an uptrend or downtrend on the chart, although it can also be used to highlight any region of importance. 

Further, you have created a general method MainAddSpan() for a ChartCls class, as part of a larger collection of methods for plotting time series data on a chart. This is so that you can conveniently draw a span of vertical lines to highlight up and down trends on a given chart.

The DbsMa indicator, in the last chart above, actually predicted the S&P 500 ["SPY"] bear market during February 2020, a few weeks before it crashed. 

Both the last two regions have been uptrends, during the months of May and July 2020, respectively.

The creation of the DbsMa indicator and how I used it is a story for another article.

## **SPOILER**

From the snapshot above, you can see that both A200 and VAS ETF in my portfolio are up 11.7% and 10.5%, respectively.

I started buying shares in the market during May 2020, and that was when the first uptrend region appeared after the crash.

## What To Do Next

You can further extend the trendet sample code in several meaningful ways:

* Identify custom trends of investpy DataFrame.
* Identify trends of custom DataFrame.
* Reading the trendet's [documentation](https://trendet.readthedocs.io).
